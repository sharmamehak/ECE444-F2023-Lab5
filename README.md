Pros and Cons of TDD: 

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an approach to writing computer programs with both its strengths and challenges. The pros of TDD include reducing mistakes and making it easier to change code as it evolves. TDD acts as a set of clear instructions for how the code should work, promoting teamwork as different team members can focus on tests and code. It encourages building the code incrementally, making it more adaptable, and provides confidence in its accuracy when all tests pass.

However, TDD has its cons. There is an initial learning curve, and it can slow down the development process, making it less suitable for projects with tight timelines. Maintaining tests can be a significant effort, and there's a risk that some aspects of the code won't be adequately covered, leading to false confidence. Tests can sometimes give misleading results, indicating everything is fine when there are actual issues. Additionally, TDD might not be the best fit for all types of projects, particularly those with rapidly changing requirements or complex user interfaces. In conclusion, TDD is a valuable tool for writing robust code, but it's not a one-size-fits-all approach and should be considered in the context of the project and the team's capabilities.
